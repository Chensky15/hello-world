Repository for lesson 1.6 

I took this course because I wanted to see if this is an option for a future program I want to apply for. 
Both my parents are in computer science based jobs, so this was an easy option for me to choose. 

I think the Github sign up page is very cool and designed to show what their website is based off of. 
Some interesting features I found was the code-like sign up page and space oriented background.
